# Exercise-3

As described in the [git-basics chapter](https://info201.github.io/git-basics.html), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.
# cd 
cd is a command used to navigate the directory tree of a computer

this command stands for **c**hange **d**irectory

Other commands are as follow
- Return to parent folder

```
